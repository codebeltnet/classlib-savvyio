# New Features
- ADDED Aggregate class in the Savvyio.Domain namespace that represents the base class from which all implementations of an Aggregate Root (as specified in Domain Driven Design) should derive
- ADDED AggregateRoot class in the Savvyio.Domain namespace that provides a way to cover the pattern of an Aggregate Root as specified in Domain Driven Design
- ADDED DomainEvent class in the Savvyio.Domain namespace that provides a default implementation of the IDomainEvent interface
- ADDED DomainEventDispatcher class in the Savvyio.Domain namespace that provides a default implementation of the IDomainEventDispatcher interface
- ADDED DomainEventDispatcherExtensions class in the Savvyio.Domain namespace that consist of extension methods for the IDomainEventDispatcher interface: RaiseMany, RaiseManyAsync
- ADDED DomainEventExtensions class in the Savvyio.Domain namespace that consist of extension methods for the IDomainEvent interface: GetEventId, GetTimestamp
- ADDED DomainEventHandler class in the Savvyio.Domain namespace that provides a generic and consistent way of handling Domain Event (as specified in Domain Driven Design) objects that implements the IDomainEvent interface
- ADDED Entity class in the Savvyio.Domain namespace that provides a way to cover the pattern of an Entity as specified in Domain Driven Design
- ADDED IAggregateRepository interface in the Savvyio.Domain namespace that defines a generic way of abstracting persistent repositories (CRUD) that is optimized for Domain Driven Design
- ADDED IAggregateRoot interface in the Savvyio.Domain namespace that defines a marker interface of an Aggregate as specified in Domain Driven Design
- ADDED IDomainEvent interface in the Savvyio.Domain namespace that defines a marker interface that specifies something that happened in the domain that you want other parts of the same domain (in-process/inner-application) to be made aware of
- ADDED IDomainEventDispatcher interface in the Savvyio.Domain namespace that defines a Domain Event dispatcher that uses Fire-and-Forget/In-Only MEP
- ADDED IDomainEventHandler interface in the Savvyio.Domain namespace that specifies a handler responsible for objects that implements the IDomainEvent interface
- ADDED IEntity interface in the Savvyio.Domain namespace that defines an Entity as specified in Domain Driven Design
- ADDED SavvyioOptionsExtensions class in the Savvyio.Domain namespace that consist of extension methods for the SavvyioOptions class: AddDomainEventHandler, AddDomainEventDispatcher
- ADDED SingleValueObject record in the Savvyio.Domain namespace that provides an implementation of ValueObject tailored for handling a single value
- ADDED ValueObject record in the Savvyio.Domain namespace that represents an object whose equality is based on the value rather than identity as specified in Domain Driven Design
- ADDED ITracedAggregateRepository interface in the Savvyio.Domain.EventSourcing namespace that defines a generic way of abstracting traced read- and writable repositories (CRud) that is optimized for Domain Driven Design
- ADDED ITracedAggregateRoot interface in the Savvyio.Domain.EventSourcing namespace that defines an Event Sourcing capable contract of an Aggregate as specified in Domain Driven Design
- ADDED ITracedDomainEvent interface in the Savvyio.Domain.EventSourcing namespace that specifies something that happened in the domain that you want other parts of the same domain (in-process/inner-application) to be aware of
